To convert a PNG image to JPG format, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
index.html , style.css and script.js
these codefiles  will allow you to select a PNG image using the file input, convert it to JPG format when you click the "Convert to JPG" button, and display the result in an img element.

Note that this is just a basic example, and you may want to add additional features, error handling, and optimizations to make it more suitable for your needs.
